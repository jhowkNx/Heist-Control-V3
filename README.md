## Welcome to Heist Control V3

### Introducing Heist Control V3

Even smarter, more robust and more effective.
The internal code of the script has been reworked, this new version was developed from scratch. Several deprecated items have been removed and we have chosen to add more cutting edge features.

We have improved the code to allow future updates to be even faster to be made and distributed.

Some new features in this new version of Heist Control

 * Smart Payout
    - Smart Payout is a feature that identifies your current Heist, the method you are choosing, and automatically it offers the best payout to all members of it.
    - Smart Payout is only compatible with Casino Heists & Doomsday Heists

 * Translation support
     - Translations can be done easily with our method
 * More Missions? 
ut multiple missions in one place? Yes, we brought that too, including the new DaX missions!**
 
**We have totally improved how presets are chosen, as well as opting to allow you to play it with its "original" payout values**
Some old features like **Cooldown Reminder** and the **Heist Inspector** are back even better.


And many other features have been improved for navigation within the script!

I appreciate the support of all the users who have used this script since when it was just a "stats editor" in December 2019, the year I created this script.
